Azure Storage accounts are the base storage type within Azure. Azure Storage offers a very scalable object store for data objects and file system services in the cloud. It can also provide a messaging store for reliable messaging, or it can act as a NoSQL store.

Azure Storage offers four configuration options:

Azure Blob: A scalable object store for text and binary data
Azure Files: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments
Azure Queue: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components
Azure Table: A NoSQL store for no-schema storage of structured data
