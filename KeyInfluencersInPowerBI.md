1. The target that is supported currently in Power BI has to be categorical (Example: What influences Rating to be High/Low)
2. In the example provided, you can select the potential influencers which can be Quantitative (size of company) or Categorical (theme - login screen, features/navigation/reliabiity), Nominal - customer/administrator/publisher  or Ordinal (Basic/Premier/Deluxe)
3. For each selected feature a graph is shown where a specific value within that feature influenced the target the most. The average influence of the other values is shown as a constant line and so how much more the most influential value affected the target can be calculated by dividing the percentage influence by average influence of the rest of the values.
